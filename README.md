## Objective
Create an Express.js web application that integrates with an external API, utilizing routers, controllers, and views to fetch and display information dynamically.

## Requirements

1. **Choose an API:**
   - Select any API of your choice from the [Public APIs repository](https://github.com/SEI-08-Bahrain/public-apis). Choose an API that aligns with your interests or the type of data you find intriguing.

2. **Express App Structure:**
   - Organize your project into a structured Express application with routers, controllers, and views. Follow a modular design to separate concerns.

3. **API Integration:**
   - Use Express routers and controllers to make HTTP requests to the chosen API.
   - Implement logic to handle API responses and extract relevant information.

4. **Views:**
   - Design views to present the fetched data using EJS. 
   - Display the information in a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing manner.

5. **Dynamic Content:**
   - Ensure that your application dynamically updates the views based on the information retrieved from the API. Use asynchronous JavaScript to handle data fetching.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement proper error handling for both API requests and any other potential issues that may arise during development.

7. **Optional Complexity:**
   - You have the flexibility to make the project as simple or complex as you desire. Implement additional features like search functionality, or data manipulation to showcase your skills.

8. **Documentation:**
   - Include a README file with brief description of the chosen API and the features you implemented.

## Submission
Submit your Github project repo in the pull request. 

**Note:** Feel free to explore different APIs and technologies to enhance the project. The goal is to demonstrate your understanding of building an Express.js application with API integration and creating a dynamic user experience.
